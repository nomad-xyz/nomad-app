    <p>Last updated: January 10, 2022</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Nomad Protocol (the “Protocol”) is a cross-chain communication
      protocol developed and provided by Illusory Systems, Inc. (“Illusory
      Systems,” “we,” “our,” “ours,” and “us”). The Protocol leverages an
      optimistic mechanism to provide fast, cheap communication for all smart
      contract chains and rollups without sacrificing decentralization or
      security. The Protocol is comprised of open-source software, which is
      publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license and located at
      <a href="https://github.com/nomad-xyz/nomad-monorepo"
        >https://github.com/nomad-xyz/nomad-monorepo</a
      >. The Protocol may be accessed through any compatible user interface,
      such as the Nomad Interface (defined below).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      These Terms of Use (the “Terms,”) govern your relationship with Illusory
      Systems and your use of (a) the Nomad website operated by us and located

      its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the “Site”) and (b) the
      Nomad Interface (the “Interface”), a website-hosted user interface
      operated by us that provides access to the Protocol and located at
      <a href="https://app.nomad.xyz">https://app.nomad.xyz</a>. These Terms
      apply to your use of all services, tools, and information made available

    <br />
    <b>6. Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties</b>

    <p>
      6.1 The Interface and the Protocol are non-custodial, meaning you are
      solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to
      the digital asset wallets you hold. These Terms are not intended to, and
      do not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent
      permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary
      duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

      OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY.
    </p>

      8.3 WE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU INCUR
      AS THE RESULT OF YOUR USE OF ANY BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OR ANY DIGITAL ASSET
      WALLET OR OTHER ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY

      WALLET OR OTHER ELECTRONIC WALLET.
    </p>

    <p>
      8.4 WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER
      FEATURES OF ANY BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK OR ANY DIGITAL ASSET WALLET OR OTHER
      ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS

      SUPPORTING THE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES,
      OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.
    </p>

    <br />
    <b>9. Indemnification. </b>

    <p>
      9.1 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify,
      defend and hold harmless Illusory Systems and our subsidiaries and
      affiliates, and each of our respective officers, directors, agents,
      partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “Illusory
      Systems Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims,
      demands, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related
      to (a) your access to or use of the Site, the Interface, or the Protocol
      (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation, misappropriation,
      or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property
      rights or privacy rights); or (d) your conduct in connection with the
      Interface or the Protocol. You agree to promptly notify Illusory Systems
      Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with Illusory Systems Parties
      in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated
      with defending such Claims (including attorneys’ fees). You also agree
      that Illusory Systems Parties will have control of the defense or
      settlement, at Illusory Systems’ sole option, of any third-party Claims.
    </p>

    <br />
    <b>10. Limitation of Liability. </b>

    <p>
      10.1 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Illusory Systems
      and the other Illusory Systems Parties will not be liable to you under any
      theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict
      liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential,
      exemplary, incidental, punitive or special damages or lost profits, even
      if Illusory Systems or the other Illusory Systems Parties have been
      advised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>

    <p>
      10.2 The total liability of Illusory Systems and the other Illusory
      Systems Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms,
      regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater of $100 or
      the amount paid by you to use the Interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      10.3 The limitations set forth in this Section 10 will not limit or
      exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional
      misconduct of Illusory Systems or the other Illusory Systems Parties or
      for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited
      under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the
      exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the
      above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <br />
    <b>11. Release.</b>

    <p>
      11.1 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release
      Illusory Systems and the other Illusory Systems Parties from
      responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and
      consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including
      claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users
      and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who
      resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil
      Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims
      which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor
      at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must
      have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”
    </p>

    <br />
    <b>12. Changes to these Terms.</b>

    <p>
      12.1 We may update, amend, alter, or modify these Terms in the future. You
      agree that Illusory Systems may make changes to these Terms at any time
      and for any reason at its sole discretion. If we make material changes to
      these Terms, we will notify you and give you an opportunity to review the
      new Terms that will supersede and replace these Terms. Your continued
      access or use of the Interface after notice of changes to these Terms will
      mean that you accept any and all of such changes. If you do not agree to
      the amended Terms, you must stop using the Interface.
    </p>

    <br />
    <b>13. Changes to the Site, the Interface, and the Protocol.</b>

    <p>
      13.1 We may update, amend, alter, change, or stop the Site, the Interface,
      or the Protocol, or any part of them, from time to time without prior
      notice to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      13.2 We do not have any maintenance, update, or support obligations with
      respect to the Site, the Interface, or the Protocol. You agree that our
      updates to the Site, the Interface, or the Protocol may change the
      requirements necessary to use the Site, the Interface, or the Protocol,
      and you agree that in such an event you are responsible for any necessary
      actions, including but not limited to updating software or hardware to
      access and use the Interface or the Protocol.
    </p>

    <p>
      13.3 We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability
      to access or use the Site, the Interface, or the Protocol.
    </p>

    <br />
    <b>14. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration.</b>

    <p>
      14.1 Please read the following section carefully because it requires you
      to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Illusory Systems and limits
      the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of
      arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or
      representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration
      provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or
      having a jury trial.
    </p>

    <p>
      14.2 No Representative Actions. You agree that any dispute arising out of
      or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Illusory
      Systems and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual
      action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or
      any other type of representative proceeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      14.3 Arbitration of Disputes. Except for disputes in which you or Illusory
      Systems seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged
      infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and
      Illusory Systems waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other
      dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, including claims related
      to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in
      court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against Illusory Systems you
      agree to first contact Illusory Systems and attempt to resolve the claim
      informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to
      Illusory Systems by email at
      <a href="mailto:legal@nomad.xyz">legal@nomad.xyz</a>. The Notice must (a)
      include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number;
      (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the
      specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that
      described above. If you and Illusory Systems cannot reach an agreement to
      resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received,
      then either party may submit the Dispute to confidential, binding
      arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the State of Utah by a
      single arbitrator pursuant to the Utah Uniform Arbitration Act and the
      Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You and Illusory
      Systems agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the
      enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally
      governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the
      “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by
      the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have
      exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions
      regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be
      available in court, including the power to determine the question of
      arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration
      and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over
      any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any
      proceeding involving more than one individual. The arbitration will allow
      for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to
      the Dispute. The arbitrator, Illusory Systems, and you will maintain the
      confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards,
      including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the
      arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have
      the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality,
      unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does
      not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or
      conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court
      application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial
      challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent
      that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      14.4 You and Illusory Systems agree that for any arbitration you initiate,
      you will pay the filing fee up to a maximum of $250, and Illusory Systems
      will pay the remaining fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by
      Illusory Systems, Illusory Systems will pay all fees and costs. You and
      Illusory Systems agree that the state or federal courts of the State of
      Utah shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the
      enforcement of an arbitration award.
    </p>

    <p>
      14.5 Any dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim
      arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you
      and Illusory Systems will not have the right to assert the claim.
    </p>

    <p>
      14.6 You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days
      of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 14 by contacting
      Illusory Systems at <a href="mailto:legal@nomad.xyz">legal@nomad.xyz</a>.
      In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name
      and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding
      arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to
      resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 15.
    </p>

    <p>
      14.7 If any portion of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable or
      unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall
      be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or
      unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of
      this Section 14 or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of any
      remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 14; and
      (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class,
      collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be
      litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
      arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall
      be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.
      Further, if any part of this Section 14 is found to prohibit an individual
      claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect
      to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and
      the remainder of this Section 14 will be enforceable.
    </p>

    <br />
    <b>15. Governing Law and Venue.</b>

    <p>
      15.1 Any dispute arising from these Terms will be governed by and
      construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah,
      except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to
      conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of
      the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that
      is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in the courts of the State
      of Utah or federal courts of the District of Utah.
    </p>
    <br />

    <b>16. Severability. </b>

    <p>
      16.1 If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful,
      void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
      severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and
      enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    </p>
    <br />

    <b>17. Feedback.</b>

    <p>
      17.1 You may voluntarily post, submit or otherwise communicate to us,
      including through third party channels (e.g., Discord), any questions,
      comments, suggestions, ideas, original or creative materials or other
      information about the Site, the Protocol, or the Interface (collectively,
      “Feedback”). By posting or submitting any Feedback to us, you hereby
      irrevocably grant to Illusory Systems a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable,
