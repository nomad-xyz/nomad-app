# Nomad Bridge Application

The official GUI for the Nomad Token Bridge. It includes integrations with both Nomad and Connext. These are two distinct protocols that are complimentary to one another. We have partnered with Connext to provide an optimal experience for users!

Nomad is a novel interoperability protocol designed to lower costs and increase security of cross-chain messaging. By leveraging an optimistic mechanism, Nomad lets users send messages and bridge assets securely. The main trade-off Nomad makes is in introducing a latency window to settle fraud proofs. However, by partnering with Connext, we achieve the holy trinity â€“ low cost, high security, and blazing fast bridging.

Connext is a network of liquidity pools on different chains. Users swap value between these pools, similar to AMM DEXes like Uniswap. Connext provides liquidity pools for Nomad assets, meaning users can receive funds on the destination chain much faster (less than 10 minutes) for an additional fee.
